## Soil Health & Testing

Healthy soil is the foundation of good farming. The app helps you track your soil condition and make it better over time.

### Why Soil Testing Matters

Good soil has billions of tiny helpful creatures called microbes. These microbes:
- Break down compost into food that plants can use
- Help plants fight off diseases naturally  
- Make soil hold water better during dry times
- Keep nutrients from washing away in heavy rain

### When to Test Your Soil

**Test every 2-3 years** if your field management stays the same.
**Test before planting** new crops or changing how you manage a field.
**Test when problems happen** like poor plant growth or yellowing leaves.
**Test after adding lots of compost** or lime to see if it worked.

### Taking Good Soil Samples

The app guides you through proper soil sampling:

**Best Time**: When soil is moist but not muddy (like a wrung-out sponge)
**How Many**: Take 15-20 random samples across each field
**How Deep**: 6-8 inches deep for most crops (3-4 inches for pasture)
**What Tools**: Clean stainless steel tools (not rusty or galvanized)
**Mix Well**: Combine all samples in a clean plastic bucket

**Avoid These Areas**:
- Near roads or fence lines
- Where animals gather regularly
- Recently fertilized or limed spots

### Understanding Your Test Results

The app shows your results with easy-to-read color charts:

**pH Level (Acidity)**:
- 6.0-7.0 is best for most crops
- Below 6.0 means soil is too acidic (add lime)
- Above 7.5 means soil is too alkaline (add sulfur)

**Organic Matter**:
- 3-5% is the goal for healthy soil
- Below 2% means you need more compost
- Higher organic matter means better soil life

**Nutrients (Phosphorus and Potassium)**:
- The app shows if levels are low, good, or high
- Low levels mean you need to add fertilizer
- High levels mean you have plenty stored up

### Adding Your Test Results

1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Soil Testing**
2. Tap **Add Soil Test**
3. Choose which field you tested
4. Select your lab or add a new one
5. Enter the numbers from your test report
6. Add any notes from the lab

The app will show your results with helpful color charts and track changes over time.

### Fixing Common Soil Problems

**Problem: Plants look pale yellow**
- Likely cause: Not enough nitrogen
- Solution: Add compost, blood meal, or other organic nitrogen

**Problem: Purple or red leaves**
- Likely cause: Not enough phosphorus  
- Solution: Add bone meal or rock phosphate; check pH

**Problem: Brown leaf edges**
- Likely cause: Not enough potassium
- Solution: Add wood ash, granite meal, or greensand

**Problem: Yellow leaves with green veins**
- Likely cause: Can't get iron (often pH problem)
- Solution: Lower pH if above 7.5; improve drainage

### Building Healthy Soil

**Add Organic Matter**: Use compost, aged manure, or cover crops
**Reduce Tillage**: Don't disturb soil more than necessary  
**Keep Soil Covered**: Use mulch or cover crops
**Rotate Crops**: Different plants feed different soil microbes
**Avoid Chemical Fertilizers**: These can kill beneficial soil life

## Lot Tracking & Traceability

The app helps you track your produce from seed to sale. This is required for food safety and organic certification.

### Creating Harvest Lots

**What is a lot?**
A lot is a specific harvest from a specific field on a specific day. Each lot gets a unique number so you can track it.

**When you harvest:**
1. Create a new lot in the app
2. Record:
   - **Date and time** of harvest
   - **Which field** it came from
   - **Crop and variety** 
   - **How much** you harvested
   - **Who** did the harvesting
   - **Equipment** used for harvest
   - **Where** you're storing it

### Complete Traceability

For each product, the app tracks the complete story:

**From Planting:**
- Where you got the seeds
- When and where you planted
- What variety you used

**During Growing:**
- All fertilizers or compost applied
- Any pest control materials used
- Workers who tended the crop
- Equipment used in the field

**At Harvest:**
- Harvest date and weather conditions
- Who picked the crop
- Equipment used for harvest
- Initial quality observations

**After Harvest:**
- Where it's stored and at what temperature
- Any processing or packing done  
- When and where it was sold
- Customer information

### Why Traceability Matters

**Food Safety**: If there's ever a problem with your produce, you can quickly find:
- Which field it came from
- What was applied to that field
- Who handled the product
- Where the rest of that lot went

**Organic Certification**: Inspectors need to see the complete chain showing:
- Organic inputs were used
- No prohibited materials were applied
- Buffer zones were maintained
- Proper record-keeping was followed

### Mock Recall Practice

**Test your system** by doing practice recalls:
1. Pick a random product you sold
2. See how quickly you can trace it back to the field
3. Find all other products from that same lot
4. Check if you can contact customers who bought it

**Good traceability means:**
- Finding the information in under 4 hours
- Having all supporting documents
- Being able to contact customers quickly

The app makes this much easier than paper records by linking everything automatically.

## Reports and Documentation

The app creates reports to help you manage your farm and meet regulatory requirements.
