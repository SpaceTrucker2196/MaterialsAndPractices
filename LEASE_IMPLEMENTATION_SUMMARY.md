- **FarmDashboardView**: Shows upcoming lease payments and urgent items
- **FieldSelectionTileView**: Visual lease status indicators on field tiles
- **LeaseManagementView**: Integrated new workflow with existing management
- **LeaseCreationWorkflowView**: Step-by-step lease creation process

### 5. Document Generation
- Markdown export for property owners
- Tax-compliant documentation
- Payment record tables
- Bulk export capabilities
- Timestamped file organization

### 6. System Integration
- **MaterialsAndPracticesApp**: Auto-initialization of lease templates
- **Core Data Integration**: Leverages existing Lease entity
- **AppTheme Compliance**: Consistent UI/UX design
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management

## Implementation Details

### Directory Structure
```
LeaseSystem/
â”œâ”€â”€ LeaseDirectoryManager.swift         # File system management
â”œâ”€â”€ LeaseTemplateSeeder.swift          # Template seeding
â”œâ”€â”€ LeaseCreationWorkflowView.swift    # Creation workflow
â”œâ”€â”€ LeaseStatusIndicator.swift         # Visual indicators
â””â”€â”€ LeaseDocumentExporter.swift       # Document generation
```

### Template Storage
- **Templates**: `Documents/Leases/LeaseTemplates/`
- **Working**: `Documents/Leases/WorkingLeaseTemplates/`
- **Completed**: `Documents/Leases/CompletedLeaseAgreements/`
- **Exports**: `Documents/LeaseExports/`

### Core Data Integration
Utilizes existing Lease entity with relationships to:
- Property (farm properties)
- Farmer (tenant information)
- Payment (payment tracking)
- Owner (property owners)

### Visual Indicators
- ðŸŸ  Orange dollar sign ($): Fields/properties without active lease coverage
- ðŸ”´ Red indicators: Overdue payments
- ðŸŸ  Orange indicators: Payments due within 30 days

## Testing Implementation
Created comprehensive test suite (`LeaseWorkflowTests.swift`) covering:
- Directory management functionality
- Template seeding operations
- Lease creation workflow
- Payment calculation logic
- Lease coverage detection
- Error handling scenarios

## Documentation Updates
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Added Lease System module documentation
- **USER_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive lease management user guide
- **Code Comments**: Detailed inline documentation
