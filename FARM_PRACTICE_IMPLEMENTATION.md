# FarmPractice Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation replaces the existing simple practice system with a comprehensive FarmPractice entity system that provides structured tracking of farm practices with detailed metadata including training requirements, frequency, and certification information.

## Core Data Model Changes

### New FarmPractice Entity (Model Version 16)
```swift
// Attributes
practiceID: UUID        // Unique identifier
name: String           // Practice name (e.g., "üß™ Soil Amendment Recordkeeping")
descriptionText: String // Detailed description of the practice
trainingRequired: String // Required training information
frequency: String      // How often the practice should be performed
certification: String // Certification requirements
lastUpdated: Date     // Last modification timestamp

// Relationships
workOrders: [WorkOrder] // Many-to-many relationship with WorkOrder
```

### Updated WorkOrder Entity
```swift
// New relationship added
farmPractices: [FarmPractice] // Many-to-many relationship with FarmPractice
```

## Predefined Practices (Auto-seeded)

The system automatically seeds 9 predefined practices based on the requirements:

1. **üß™ Soil Amendment Recordkeeping**
   - Track soil inputs, compost, manure applications
   - Training: Organic soil health, OMRI-compliant materials handling
   - Frequency: Every amendment event
   - Certification: NOP Organic Certification

2. **üå± Seed Source Documentation**
   - Maintain seed purchase records with organic status
   - Training: Organic seed sourcing standards
   - Frequency: Per purchase/order
   - Certification: NOP Organic Certification

3. **üêû Pest and Weed Management Log**
   - Document pest control activities
   - Training: Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
   - Frequency: Every application or activity
   - Certification: NOP Organic Certification

4. **üåæ Harvest Recordkeeping**
   - Track harvest quantities and traceability
   - Training: Organic traceability and documentation
   - Frequency: Every harvest event
   - Certification: NOP Organic Certification

5. **üßº Worker Hygiene and Food Safety Training**
   - Document employee hygiene training
   - Training: USDA GAP worker hygiene training
   - Frequency: Annually or upon hiring
   - Certification: USDA GAP / Harmonized GAP

6. **üíß Water Source and Quality Monitoring**
   - Record water sources and testing results
   - Training: Water safety standards
   - Frequency: Quarterly or per certifier requirement
   - Certification: USDA GAP, Organic Certification

7. **‚ôªÔ∏è Manure and Compost Application Log**
   - Log manure/compost details including aging and ratios
   - Training: Compost safety and NOP compliance
   - Frequency: Every use or turn event
   - Certification: NOP Organic Certification

8. **üßΩ Equipment Sanitation Log**
   - Track cleaning and sanitizing activities
   - Training: Food safety sanitation protocols
   - Frequency: Daily or before/after each use
   - Certification: USDA GAP

9. **üîç Traceability Lot Codes and Product Flow**
   - Track produce from field to customer
   - Training: Food traceability and lot tracking systems
   - Frequency: Per harvest and shipment
   - Certification: USDA GAP, NOP Organic Certification

## User Interface Updates

### WorkOrderDetailView
- **Replaced**: Simple practice text fields
- **With**: Structured FarmPractice selector with visual practice tiles
- **Features**: 
  - Multiple practice selection
  - Detailed practice information sheets
  - Visual indicators for selected practices
  - Practice count display

### Practice Management (Utilities ‚Üí Practice Management)
- **Overview Dashboard**: Shows total practices, work orders, and usage statistics
- **Practice Sections**: Work orders grouped by practice
- **Usage Tracking**: Identifies used vs unused practices
- **Practice Details**: Full practice information with requirements
- **Create/Edit**: Add new custom practices

### Audit Trail Enhancement
- Work order completion now includes selected farm practices
- Format: `"Farm Practices Applied: Practice1, Practice2, Practice3"`
- Integrated with existing amendment tracking

## Code Architecture

### Clean Architecture Compliance
```
Domain Layer (Entities):
- FarmPractice entity with business rules
- WorkOrder relationship management

Use Cases:
- Practice selection and validation
- Work order completion with practice tracking

Interface Adapters:
- FarmPracticeSelectionView (UI presentation)
- PracticeManagementView (practice oversight)
- FarmPracticeSeeder (data initialization)

Frameworks:
- Core Data persistence
- SwiftUI presentation
```

### Key Files Created/Modified

**Core Data:**
- `MaterialsAndPractices 16.xcdatamodel` - Updated model
- `FarmPractice+CoreDataClass.swift` - Entity class with business logic
- `FarmPractice+CoreDataProperties.swift` - Core Data properties

**Views:**
- `FarmPracticeSelectionView.swift` - Practice selection interface
- `FarmPracticeDetailView.swift` - Detailed practice information
- `PracticeManagementView.swift` - Practice management dashboard

**Data Management:**
- `FarmPracticeSeeder.swift` - Default practice seeding
- `WorkOrderDetailView.swift` - Updated for new practice system
- `UtilitiesView.swift` - Added Practice Management button
- `MaterialsAndPracticesApp.swift` - Added practice seeding on startup

## Integration Points

### Work Order Creation
1. User selects farm practices from visual selector
2. Practices are linked to work order via many-to-many relationship
3. Validation ensures at least one practice is selected

### Work Order Completion
1. System records completion in audit trail
2. Includes list of applied practices and amendments
3. Creates comprehensive compliance record

### Practice Management
1. View all practices organized by usage
2. See which work orders use each practice
3. Create custom practices for farm-specific needs
4. Monitor compliance across all operations

## Benefits

1. **Structured Data**: Replaces free-text with structured practice entities
2. **Compliance Tracking**: Built-in certification and training requirements
3. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive records for regulatory compliance
4. **Flexibility**: Support for both predefined and custom practices
5. **Reporting**: Easy to generate practice usage and compliance reports
6. **Training Integration**: Clear training requirements for each practice

## Future Enhancements

1. **Practice Scheduling**: Automatic reminders based on frequency
2. **Training Integration**: Link to actual training records
3. **Compliance Reports**: Automated compliance reporting
4. **Practice Templates**: Industry-specific practice sets
5. **Seasonal Planning**: Practice scheduling based on growing seasons
