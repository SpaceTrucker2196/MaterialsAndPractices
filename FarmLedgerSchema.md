# üìí Farm Ledger Schema for Small Farms with Organic Certification

This schema is designed to help a small farm maintain records that follow **Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)**, meet **USDA recommendations**, and support **organic certification requirements**.  
Each field has a description written in plain farm-owner terms, explaining *how to collect the data*, *why it matters*, and whether it is a field you enter or one that is calculated from other data.

## Ledger Fields

### TransactionID  
- **Description**: A unique number automatically assigned to each transaction. Think of this as the ‚Äúrow number‚Äù or ‚Äúentry tag‚Äù in your checkbook ledger.  
- **How to Track**: Generated by your accounting system, so you don‚Äôt need to make it up yourself.  
- **Why It Matters**: Ensures every entry can be traced and not altered without leaving a record. Auditors and certifiers like to see a clear audit trail.  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Calculated/Auto-generated*  

### DocumentIdentifier  
- **Description**: A GUID (globally unique identifier) that connects each transaction to a supporting file, like a scanned receipt, supplier invoice, or USDA organic approval letter.  
- **How to Track**: Most farm accounting software can attach a file or at least a link to one. Scan paper receipts, or save PDFs of invoices and link them here.  
- **Why It Matters**: Organic certifiers require you to prove that the inputs you bought (like seeds, fertilizer, soil amendments) are allowed. Having this direct link prevents scrambling during inspections.  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Calculated/Auto-generated*  

### Date  
- **Description**: The calendar date when the transaction occurred.  
- **How to Track**: Use the date on the receipt, invoice, or the day you sold something. For labor or application events, use the day work was done.  
- **Why It Matters**: USDA inspections compare ledger dates against field records (e.g., when compost was applied, or when harvests occurred). Proper dating also satisfies GAAP‚Äôs matching principle (expenses and revenue must line up in the correct season).  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Manual*  

### Description  
- **Description**: A short but detailed explanation of the transaction (e.g., ‚ÄúPurchased organic carrot seed from Johnny‚Äôs Seeds, Lot #1234‚Äù or ‚ÄúSold 40 CSA shares ‚Äì Spring 2025‚Äù).  
- **How to Track**: Write down enough detail that you could understand what the expense or income was years from now. Always include supplier names, lot numbers, or customer notes if relevant.  
- **Why It Matters**: Organic audits often require that purchases be linked to seed and input logs. A vague entry like ‚Äúseeds‚Äù won‚Äôt cut it‚Äîinspectors want to know *what seeds, from where, and whether they were organic-approved*.  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Manual*  

### AccountType  
- **Description**: Identifies whether the entry is an *Income*, *Expense*, *Asset*, *Liability*, or *Equity* entry.  
- **How to Track**: This is chosen based on the type of transaction. Example: seeds ‚Üí Expense, tractor purchase ‚Üí Asset, CSA income ‚Üí Income, loan ‚Üí Liability.  
- **Why It Matters**: Organizes your books under GAAP, and ensures you can prepare tax forms (like Schedule F) without re-sorting your data later.  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Manual (choose from list)*  

### Category  
- **Description**: More specific than AccountType, categories track farm-specific uses like **Seeds, Feed, Fertilizer, Fuel, Labor, Equipment, Produce Sales, Grants, or Repairs**.  
- **How to Track**: Use consistent categories year-to-year. USDA recommends categories that match farm enterprise budgets.  
- **Why It Matters**: Categories allow you to evaluate profitability by activity (e.g., are your tomatoes making money after seed, fertilizer, and labor?). They also simplify IRS reporting.  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Manual*  

### Vendor/Customer  
- **Description**: The name of the person or business you bought from or sold to.  
- **How to Track**: Record exactly as it appears on invoices or receipts. For sales, list the buyer (e.g., ‚ÄúLa Crosse Food Co-op‚Äù).  
- **Why It Matters**: Organic rules require supplier traceability. If your certifier asks ‚ÄúWhere did this amendment come from?‚Äù you can prove it. It also helps track which markets are your best customers.  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Manual*  

### Invoice/ReceiptNo  
- **Description**: The number on the receipt or invoice tied to the transaction.  
- **How to Track**: Write down or attach the number exactly as it appears. If none exists, make your own numbering system.  
- **Why It Matters**: Ensures you can match ledger entries to documents during an audit. Auditors dislike ‚Äúorphan entries‚Äù with no proof attached.  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Manual*  

### PaymentMethod  
- **Description**: How you paid (cash, check, credit card, ACH, barter).  
- **How to Track**: Record as shown on your bank or credit card statement. If you traded (bartered), note what was exchanged.  
- **Why It Matters**: Supports bank reconciliation, and barter transactions must still be tracked for IRS and USDA.  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Manual*  

### Debit / Credit  
- **Description**: The dollar value of money going out (Debit) or coming in (Credit).  
- **How to Track**: Enter the exact amount from receipts, invoices, or sales records. For cash sales, deposit slips should match.  
- **Why It Matters**: Double-entry accounting requires both sides (outflow/inflow). This ensures books balance and prevents ‚Äúmissing money.‚Äù  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Manual*  

### Balance  
- **Description**: Running total of the account after each transaction.  
- **How to Track**: Calculated automatically by the ledger.  
- **Why It Matters**: Shows current cash or account standing without needing to re-total every time. Used for reconciling to bank statements.  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Calculated (rolling total)*  

### CheckNumber  
- **Description**: Number of the check used for payment.  
- **How to Track**: Copy from the check itself. If no check was used, leave blank.  
- **Why It Matters**: Helps reconcile check registers and prevents fraud or double counting.  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Manual*  

### FarmEnterprise  
- **Description**: Which part of the farm the transaction relates to (Vegetables, Livestock, Dairy, Orchard, etc.).  
- **How to Track**: Tag each expense or sale with the enterprise it supports.  
- **Why It Matters**: USDA encourages enterprise budgets to see which parts of the farm are profitable. Certifiers may also want evidence that costs tie to organic vs. non-organic enterprises.  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Manual*  

### Property/FieldID  
- **Description**: Identifier for the specific field or property.  
- **How to Track**: Use a farm map and give each field a name or code (e.g., ‚ÄúNorth 40‚Äù, ‚ÄúField A‚Äù). Record this ID for all field-based expenses or harvests.  
- **Why It Matters**: Organic certification requires a field history log‚Äîshowing all inputs applied to a specific land unit. This field links the ledger to those maps.  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Manual*  

### CropOrAnimalID  
- **Description**: Identifies the crop planting, herd, or flock associated with the transaction.  
- **How to Track**: Use planting logs or livestock records (e.g., ‚ÄúTomato 2025 Planting 1‚Äù or ‚ÄúBroiler Batch March 2025‚Äù).  
- **Why It Matters**: Traceability is critical for organic. Auditors may ask: ‚ÄúWhich chickens ate this feed?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhich field got this compost?‚Äù  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Manual*  

### SeedSource  
- **Description**: The seed supplier, lot number, and whether it was certified organic.  
- **How to Track**: Save seed packets, invoices, and supplier organic certificates. Enter lot numbers exactly.  
- **Why It Matters**: Organic inspectors need to see that you used organic seed when available, and documented exceptions if not. Missing this info can cause certification issues.  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Manual*  

### InputType  
- **Description**: Type of input (fertilizer, compost, pesticide, soil amendment).  
- **How to Track**: Record name from label and keep supplier documentation.  
- **Why It Matters**: Organic certification requires every input to be documented. This ensures compliance with the National Organic Program (NOP).  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Manual*  

### OrganicApproval  
- **Description**: Whether the input is OMRI-listed or otherwise certifier-approved.  
- **How to Track**: Verify against OMRI or certifier lists, and keep documentation.  
- **Why It Matters**: You cannot use unapproved substances in organic farming. Tracking approval prevents mistakes.  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Manual*  

### ApplicationDate  
- **Description**: Date an input (fertilizer, compost, pesticide) was applied.  
- **How to Track**: Enter from your field log. Match against purchase invoices for verification.  
- **Why It Matters**: Required for organic traceability. Inspectors look for gaps (e.g., inputs applied during prohibited times).  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Manual*  

### HarvestBatchID  
- **Description**: Identifier for a harvested batch.  
- **How to Track**: Create batch codes (e.g., ‚ÄúTomato2025-Batch01‚Äù). Record in harvest log and sales receipts.  
- **Why It Matters**: Supports farm-to-market traceability. If there‚Äôs a recall, you‚Äôll know exactly which sales tied to which harvest.  
- **Entry or Calculated**: *Manual*  

### CertificationDocs  
- **Description**: Links or references to certification documents for inputs or products.  
- **How to Track**: Save files as PDF and reference them here.

- **Entry or Calculated**: *Manual (link or file reference)*  

### LaborHours  
- **Description**: Worker hours tied to this transaction.  
- **How to Track**: Collect from timesheets or work logs. For family labor, still track estimated hours.
