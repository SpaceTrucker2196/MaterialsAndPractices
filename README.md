**Q: Can I use the system offline?**  
A: The mobile app has limited offline functionality, but will sync data when connectivity is restored.

**Q: How does the system help with organic certification?**  
A: The system automatically organizes all documentation required for certification, tracks compliance issues in real-time, and can generate complete reports for inspectors.

**Q: Who can see worker health and safety records?**  
A: Access to sensitive worker information is restricted by permission level. Farm administrators and designated safety officers typically have access.
