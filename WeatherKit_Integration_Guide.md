# WeatherKit Integration and Agricultural Timing Features

This update enhances the MaterialsAndPractices app with Apple's WeatherKit integration and adds comprehensive agricultural timing guidance based on astronomical calculations.

## New Features

### 1. WeatherKit Integration
- **Enhanced Weather Data**: Replaced NOAA API with Apple's WeatherKit for more accurate and comprehensive weather information
- **Better Coverage**: WeatherKit provides global coverage vs NOAA's US-only coverage
- **Improved Accuracy**: Higher precision weather data with better forecasting
- **Native Integration**: Seamless integration with iOS ecosystem

### 2. Season Display
- **Astronomical Accuracy**: Uses precise solstice and equinox calculations
- **Real-time Updates**: Current season display with countdown to next transition
- **Agricultural Context**: Season-specific agricultural guidance and recommendations

### 3. Moon Phase Display
- **Precise Calculations**: Astronomical algorithms for accurate lunar phase determination
- **Agricultural Significance**: Traditional lunar gardening principles integrated with modern UX
- **Timing Guidance**: Optimal planting and harvesting windows based on moon phases

### 4. Enhanced Dashboard
- **Unified Interface**: Weather, season, and moon phase information in one view
- **Agricultural Guidance**: Contextual recommendations for farming activities
- **Visual Clarity**: Intuitive icons and colors for quick understanding

## Technical Implementation

### New Components
- `SeasonCalculator.swift`: Astronomical season calculations
- `MoonPhaseCalculator.swift`: Lunar phase calculations using Julian dates
- `SeasonMoonView.swift`: Combined UI component for season/moon display
- `WeatherKitService.swift`: WeatherKit integration service
- Updated `WeatherService.swift`: Smart service selection (WeatherKit vs NOAA)
- Updated `CurrentGrowsView.swift`: Enhanced dashboard with new features

### Backward Compatibility
- iOS 16+ uses WeatherKit for optimal experience
- iOS 15 and below fallback to existing NOAA service
- Graceful degradation ensures app works on all supported iOS versions

### Agricultural Intelligence
- **Season-based Recommendations**: Tailored advice based on current season
- **Lunar Gardening**: Traditional moon phase gardening principles
- **Combined Guidance**: Smart recommendations considering both factors
- **Timing Optimization**: Best times for planting, harvesting, and other activities

## Usage

### For Farmers and Gardeners
1. **Check Current Conditions**: View real-time weather data on the dashboard
2. **Plan Activities**: Use season and moon phase guidance for optimal timing
3. **Track Progress**: Monitor your grows with enhanced environmental context

### For Developers
1. **Add to Project**: Include new Swift files in Xcode project
2. **Configure WeatherKit**: Add WeatherKit framework to project target
3. **Update Deployment**: Consider iOS 16+ for full WeatherKit features

## Configuration Required
