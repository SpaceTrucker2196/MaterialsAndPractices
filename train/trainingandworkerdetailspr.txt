Worker Detail View UI UX.

The worker detail view should have an edit mode which lets you edit information from the worker core data enity.

The worker detail should display all properties from the worker enity. 

the first section should be split between the profile image and a view containing Position Email Phone and Hire date, also use the data function to diplay the full day name of the date the worker was hired .

The time clock view should be evenly split between the clock chart. 
the clockin button test should say start work - stop work instad of clock in clock out
the chart for the clock has the wrong colors. starting clockwise the first 8 hours of the day should be green for normal work time. Yellow for the first hour of over time, orange for the next 3 hours of over time and red for the rest of the day
the chart should have a thicker donut. the circle is too thin. keep the data in the center that is good.
make sure clockin and clock out have colors in the assets file 
The this week section should list all clockin - clockout times for the week. section this list by day. 
The time clock should track hours in blocks so that a worker can checkin and check out multiple times during the day. lie 7am - 10 am 1pm - 5pm for single work day. make tests to test this feature with multiple blocks in a single day.

# üßæ Farm Training Compliance Schemas

This document defines two interrelated schemas for tracking **employee training** and **course requirements** on a farm to ensure **compliance with USDA Organic, FSMA, OSHA, and GAP standards**.

## ‚úÖ Usage Notes

- These schemas are designed for integration in mobile apps, spreadsheets, or farm compliance databases.
- All records should be **digitally archived for at least 5 years** for audit and traceability.
- If you are working toward **organic certification**, tie each course to **NOP 205 references**.

create a relation to worker to track these

Competed training section in worker details should list all trainings that are completed by the worker by topic.
Tapping a completed training will open a detail view with all the enity information. tapping edit will let you edit the entity. 
utilities will have a assign training button that will assign training courses by listing all the courses.
utilities should have a manage training button that will take you to a list of trainings. selecting training will take you to a a detail view that shows metadata about the training and below a list of all the worker and their training status for that course. you can tap a worker to assign training or refresh training if they already completed in the past. 

The employee detail view should show all the open work orders for the worker followed by all completed work orders for the last month. There should be a work order history botton that opens a complete work order history with filtering and search. taping on a work order will open the workorderdetails view. 

after 2 rows of space there should be a button that says off board worker that sets the worker into inactive status and hides them from view in the app. 

create tests for the work order feature
when the app launches check for courses if not load this data from an enun:
