# Compost Safety Best Practices Guide

---

### Introduction

The rise in home and small-farm composting, especially for no-dig and deep mulch gardening, has brought greater attention to the quality and safety of compost inputs. While composting remains an essential technique for building soil fertility and microbial life, poorly managed or contaminated compost can introduce serious issues to your growing system. This guide outlines key compost safety risks, detection methods, and best practices to mitigate harm to crops, soil, and human health.

### 1. Immature Compost Risks

**Nitrogenous Compost (Too "Hot")**
- Often contains fresh manure or other nitrogen-rich materials that haven’t fully decomposed.
- Symptoms: Ammonia smell, root burn, excess leaf nitrates.
- Risks: Can harbor pathogens (e.g. *E. coli*, *Salmonella*), leach nitrates into water, damage seedlings.
- **Remedy**: Cure compost 3–6 months in moist, aerated conditions before use.

**Carbonaceous Compost (Too Woody)**
- Excessive unbroken wood chips or straw.
- Risks: Ties up nitrogen in soil (immobilization), causing stunted plant growth.
- **Remedy**: Compost longer; maintain proper carbon-to-nitrogen ratios (~30:1); screen finished compost.

### 2. Persistent Herbicides (Pyralids)

**Key Chemicals**: Aminopyralid, Clopyralid, Picloram.
- **Sources**: Hay, straw, or manure from livestock fed sprayed forage.
- **Persistence**: Can remain active in soil or compost for 1–3 years.
- **Sensitivity**: Damaging at levels as low as 1 part per billion (ppb).
- **Plant Symptoms**: Twisting, cupping, and distortion in tomatoes, legumes, sunflowers.
- **Testing**: Bioassay (see below); lab tests cost $400+ per compound.

**Bioassay Method**
1. Mix 1:1 suspect compost and known clean potting mix.
2. Fill pots; plant beans or tomatoes.
3. Grow 3–4 weeks alongside a clean control.
4. Look for deformities in test plants.

### 3. PFAS (“Forever Chemicals”)

**Definition**: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances.
- **Used In**: Nonstick coatings, water-resistant food packaging, fire-fighting foams.
- **Pathways into Compost**: Compostable food containers, biosolids, contaminated paper/cardboard.
- **Risks**: Persist in environment indefinitely, bioaccumulate in human and animal tissues.
- **Health Links**: Cancer, liver damage, reproductive and immune disruption.

**Prevention Tips**
- Avoid composting glossy paper, biosolids, synthetic packaging.
- Source compost from suppliers who monitor inputs and reject contaminated feedstocks.

### 4. Microbial and Physical Contaminants

**Pathogens**
- Risks: *E. coli*, *Salmonella*, *Listeria* from untreated manure.
- **Solution**: Hot composting (131°F/55°C for 15+ days, turned 5 times) per USDA/OMRI standards.

**Foreign Objects**
- Risks: Syringes, plastics, underwear (!), often from municipal or curbside collections.
- **Solution**: Inspect inputs, avoid curbside waste streams, screen final compost.

### 5. Safe Sourcing and Remediation

**Safe Purchasing Tips**
- Ask if horse or livestock manure was used.
- Confirm if suppliers test or bioassay for pyralids.
- Prefer compost made from plant-based, NOP-compliant inputs.

**Remediation Options for Contaminated Soil**
- Grow cover crops or ornamentals—not food.
- Add high-carbon materials (biochar, wood chips) to bind residues.
- Keep soil biologically active (living roots, microbial activity).
- Time is the only full detox: 1–3 years for pyralids.
