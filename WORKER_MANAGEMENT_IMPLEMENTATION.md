# Worker Management System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive worker management functionality to the MaterialsAndPractices farm management application, including worker onboarding, time tracking, job completion monitoring, and visual status indicators.

## Implemented Features

### 1. New Worker Creation Workflow

**Location:** `MaterialsAndPractices/Farm/WorkerManagementViews.swift` - `CreateWorkerView`

**Features:**
- Comprehensive worker profile form with photo capability
- All Worker entity fields included (excluding time tracking data)
- Photo capture/selection using camera or photo library
- Form validation and error handling
- Accessible from Utilities view "Add New Worker" button

**Fields Included:**
- Profile photo (optional)
- Full name (required)
- Position/Title
- Email address
- Phone number
- Emergency contact name and phone
- Hire date
- Active status toggle
- Notes

### 2. Enhanced Worker Detail View

**Location:** `MaterialsAndPractices/Farm/WorkerManagementViews.swift` - `WorkerDetailView`

**Features:**
- Complete worker information display
- Time clock functionality (clock in/out)
- Current week hours tracking
- Weekly summary with overtime detection
- Link to weekly time calendar view

### 3. Job Completion Tracking

**Location:** 
- Core Data Model: `MaterialsAndPractices.xcdatamodeld/MaterialsAndPractices 4.xcdatamodel/contents`
- UI: `MaterialsAndPractices/Practice/WorkPracticeDetailView.swift`

**Features:**
- Added `jobCompleted` boolean field to Work entity
- Added `jobCompleteTimestamp` date field to Work entity
- Automatic timestamp insertion when job is marked complete
- Toggle functionality in WorkPracticeDetailView
- Timestamp clearing when job is unmarked

### 4. Enhanced Farm Dashboard Worker Display

**Location:** `MaterialsAndPractices/Farm/FarmDashboardView.swift` - `TeamMemberTile`

**Features:**
- Color-coded worker tiles based on status:
  - **Green background/border**: Clocked in workers
  - **Blue background/border**: Clocked out workers  
  - **Grey background**: Idle workers (not assigned to practice)
- Status tags:
  - **Red "Working" tag**: Workers assigned to active practice
  - **Yellow "Idle" tag**: Workers not assigned and not clocked in
- Real-time clock status indicators

### 5. Weekly Time Tracking Calendar

**Location:** `MaterialsAndPractices/Farm/WorkerManagementViews.swift` - `WorkerWeeklyTimeView`

**Features:**
- Week-by-week navigation
- Daily time entry display showing punch in/out times
- Weekly total hours calculation
- Overtime detection and warnings
- Clean calendar-style interface
- Integration with existing TimeClock entities

## Core Data Model Changes

### Work Entity Updates
```
- jobCompleted: Boolean (default: false)
- jobCompleteTimestamp: Date (optional)
```

These fields enable tracking of practice completion status with automatic timestamping.

## User Interface Flow

1. **Adding a Worker:**
   - Navigate to Utilities â†’ "Add New Worker"
   - Fill out comprehensive profile form
   - Optionally add profile photo
   - Save to create new worker

2. **Viewing Worker Details:**
   - Tap any worker tile from farm dashboard or worker list
   - View complete worker information
   - Use clock in/out functionality
   - Access weekly time calendar

3. **Managing Job Completion:**
   - Open any practice detail view
   - Toggle "Job Completed" switch
   - Automatic timestamp recording

4. **Monitoring Worker Status:**
   - Farm dashboard shows all workers with color coding
   - Quick visual identification of worker status
   - Status tags indicate working/idle states

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Photo Management
- Uses existing `PhotoManager` and `GenericPhotoCaptureView`
- Stores photos as binary data in Worker.profilePhotoData
- JPEG compression at 0.7 quality for storage efficiency

### Time Tracking Integration
- Leverages existing TimeClock entity relationships
- Monday-to-Sunday week calculation
- Real-time status detection for dashboard display

### Status Logic
- Clock status: Based on active TimeClock entry for current day
- Assignment status: Placeholder for future practice assignment logic
- Color coding follows consistent design system using AppTheme

### Responsive Design
- Grid layouts adapt to screen sizes
- Consistent spacing using AppTheme.Spacing
- Proper navigation and sheet presentations

## Testing
- Added comprehensive test suite in `WorkerManagementTests.swift`
- Tests cover worker creation, photo storage, job completion, and time clock integration
- Uses in-memory Core Data stack for isolated testing

## Future Enhancements
- Worker assignment to specific practices/fields
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Push notifications for incomplete tasks
- Integration with payroll systems
- Worker performance tracking
