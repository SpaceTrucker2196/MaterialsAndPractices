## Data Access Patterns

### Common Fetch Requests

#### Active Grows Query
```swift
@FetchRequest(
    entity: Grow.entity(),
    sortDescriptors: [
        NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \Grow.field?.property?.displayName, ascending: true),
        NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \Grow.title, ascending: true)
    ],
    predicate: NSPredicate(format: "harvestDate == nil"),
    animation: .default
)
private var activeGrows: FetchedResults<Grow>
```

#### Worker Time Tracking Query
```swift
@FetchRequest(
    entity: TimeClock.entity(),
    sortDescriptors: [NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \TimeClock.date, ascending: false)],
    predicate: NSPredicate(format: "year == %d AND weekNumber == %d", year, week),
    animation: .default
)
private var weeklyTimeEntries: FetchedResults<TimeClock>
```

#### Work Order Status Query
```swift
@FetchRequest(
    entity: WorkOrder.entity(),
    sortDescriptors: [NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \WorkOrder.createdDate, ascending: false)],
    predicate: NSPredicate(format: "isCompleted == NO"),
    animation: .default
)
private var activeWorkOrders: FetchedResults<WorkOrder>
```

## Performance Considerations

### Fetch Indexes
Strategic indexes are implemented for optimal query performance:

- **UUID-based lookups**: All entities have `byIdIndex`
- **Name-based searches**: Entities with names have `byNameIndex`
- **Date-based queries**: Time-sensitive entities have `byDateIndex`
- **Status filtering**: Status-driven entities have `byStatusIndex`
- **Composite indexes**: Complex queries use multi-field indexes (e.g., `byWeekYearIndex`)

### Relationship Optimization
- **Cascade deletions**: Child entities automatically deleted with parents
- **Nullify relationships**: Prevent orphaned records
- **Fetch batching**: Large datasets use batch fetching
- **Faulting**: Core Data automatic memory management

### CloudKit Synchronization
- **Automatic sync**: Changes propagate across devices
- **Conflict resolution**: Core Data handles merge conflicts
- **Schema evolution**: CloudKit schema updates with model versions
- **Security**: iCloud encryption for data protection
